Simple maze solver!

Okay maybe not so simple and surely wont be very efficient immediately.

A* - attempts every possible valid move (more or less...)

Conditions:
x - indicates a wall, the user can not move onto or through an x
o - the user, can move up, down, left, or right but should do so on its own
E - the endgame! The user is trying to reach this location

There is no user input for this (yet) and is therefor a simple (and terrible)
AI.

Future work after the game can solve itself
-custom maps through file input
-ability to determine if a map is solvable
-optimization of algorithm to find end
-user input, because who doesn't want a text based maze game...
